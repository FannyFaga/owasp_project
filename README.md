Project Description

The project includes:

A full security assessment of a web application (manual and automated testing).

A final report explaining discovered vulnerabilities, their impact, and remediation recommendations.

Evidence and reproducible steps (screenshots, logs, proof-of-concept) to demonstrate findings and fixes.

The main report is available as rapportfinal.pdf in the repository root.

Objectives

Apply OWASP methodology to audit a web application.

Detect and classify common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).

Assess risk and propose practical technical and organizational mitigations.

Document tests and results so they are reproducible.
